You can turn off the systemd timer for your program using the following commands:

To stop the timer temporarily (until next reboot):

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mavlink-precision-landing.timer
```

To both stop the timer and prevent it from starting on future reboots:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mavlink-precision-landing.timer
sudo systemctl disable mavlink-precision-landing.timer
```

If the service is currently running and you want to stop it immediately:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mavlink-precision-landing.service
```

You can check the status to confirm it's been stopped:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mavlink-precision-landing.timer
sudo systemctl status mavlink-precision-landing.service
```

If you want to completely remove the configuration (though this isn't usually necessary):

```bash
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/mavlink-precision-landing.timer
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/mavlink-precision-landing.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

These commands give you full control over when your program runs, allowing you to temporarily disable it or permanently remove it from the startup sequence.


Start:
sudo systemctl enable mavlink-precision-landing.timer
sudo systemctl start mavlink-precision-landing.timer
